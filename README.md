# GDExtension based Git Plugin for Godot

Git implementation of the Godot Engine VCS interface in Godot. We use [libgit2](https://libgit2.org) as our backend to simulate Git in code.

> Planned for the upcoming version of Godot. Look for other branches for support in other Godot releases.

## Installation Instructions

1.  Grab the platform binaries here: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-git-plugin/releases>
2.  Then read the installation instructions: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-git-plugin/wiki

## Build Instructions

This section onwards is only meant to be used if you intend to compile the plugin from source.

### Required Tools

- Full copy of the source code. Remember to use `git clone --recursive`.
- [SCons](https://scons.org/pages/download.html) (v3.0.1+)
- C++17 and C90 compilers detectable by SCons and present in `PATH`.
- Platforms Specific Setup
  - Windows
    - No extra steps required other than setting up the compilers.
  - MacOS
    - For making universal builds targeting both Apple Silicon and x86_64, you can optionally run `build_openssl_universal_osx.sh` to build OpenSSL yourself and replace the already prebuilt libraries provided inside `thirdparty/openssl/`, otherwise, just run `brew install openssl@1.1` to use the prebuilt libraries provided in this repository.
  - Linux
    - Run `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`, or your local package manager's equivalent.

### Release Build

```
scons platform=<platform> target=release -j 6
```

For more build options, run `scons platform=<platform> -h`

## Dev builds

When new features are being worked on for the Godot VCS Integration, the build process sometimes requires developers to make changes in the GDExtension API along with this plugin. This means we need to manually generate the GDExtension API from the custom Godot builds and then use it to compile godot-cpp.

If you need to use a custom GDExtension API:

```
scons platform=<platform> target=debug godot_cpp=yes generate_bindings=yes bits=64 use_custom_api_file=yes custom_api_file=path/to/extension_api.json -j 6
```

You only need to build godot-cpp once every change in the GDExtension API, hence, this command should only be run the first time after generating a new JSON API file.

To reuse the once-built godot-cpp library:

```
scons platform=<platform> target=debug -j 6
```

To view more options available while recompiling godot-cpp, run `scons platform=<platform> godot_cpp=yes -h`.
