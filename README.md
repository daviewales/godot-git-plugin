# Godot Git Plugin

Git implementation of the Godot Engine VCS interface using GDNative in Godot. We use [libgit2](https://libgit2.org) as our backend to simulate Git in code.

> Supported in Godot 3.5.x. Look for other branches for support in other Godot releases.

## Installation Instructions

1.  Grab the platform binaries here: <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-git-plugin/releases>
2.  Then read the installation instructions: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-git-plugin/wiki

## Build Instructions

This section onwards is only meant to be used if you intend to compile the plugin from source.

### Required Tools

- Full copy of the source code. Remember to use `git clone --recursive`.
- [SCons](https://scons.org/pages/download.html) (v3.0.1+)
- C++17 and C90 compilers detectable by SCons and present in `PATH`.
- Platforms Specific Setup
  - Windows
    - No extra steps required other than setting up the compilers.
  - MacOS
    - For making universal builds targeting both Apple Silicon and x86_64, you can optionally run `build_openssl_universal_osx.sh` to build OpenSSL yourself and replace the already prebuilt libraries provided inside `thirdparty/openssl/`, otherwise, just run `brew install openssl@1.1`.
  - Linux
    - Run `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`, or local package manager equivalent.

### Build

```
scons platform=<platform> target=release bits=64 -j 6
```

For more build options, run `scons platform=<platform> -h`

## Bleeding Edge

Most of the times when new features are being worked on for the Godot VCS Integration, it requires developers to make changes in the Godot Editor source code along with this plugin. This means we need to manually generate the GDNative API from the custom Godot builds and then use it to compile godot-cpp.

To build using custom GDNative API definition JSON files, run the below helper command:

```
scons platform=<platform> target=debug godot_cpp=yes generate_bindings=yes bits=64 use_custom_api_file=yes custom_api_file=path/to/api.json -j 6
```

Once this command is completed successfully, the standard build commands in the above section can be run without recompiling godot-cpp. Once compiled, to stop godot-cpp from recompiling, do not use the `godot_cpp` option in SCons arguments. To view more options available while recompiling godot-cpp, run `scons platform=<platform> godot_cpp=yes -h`.
